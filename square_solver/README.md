# HOW TO BUILD IT INTO EXECUTABLE FILE (.EXE) FOR WINDOWS:
## test.exe
*This file will start unit tests for our that solves square equation

  1. install g++ compiler
  2. download files ( all .c and .bat ) in directory, open cmd in this directory
  3. start test.bat

*After that will be created test.exe in this directory*
## square_solver.exe
*This file will start programm that solves square equation, using your input coefficients

  4. start square_sovler.bat

*After that will be created square_solver.exe in the directory*

That is how interface looks like:

# Having troubles with square equation in your project?
You can use functions from my project!

*More details about functions used in project you can get in documentation: check docs.rar/index.html file
