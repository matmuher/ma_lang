Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia

KING  Pretty Ophelia
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna
yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab
And fall a-cursing like a very drab
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb

Why as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric

And that our drift look through our bad
KING  Dead
How now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead
HAMLET  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
A second time I kill my husband dead
We should profane the service of the dead
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
But let it be.--Horatio, I am dead
your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead
her soul, she's dead
In the same figure like the King that's dead
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
No, no, he is dead
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
With bisson rheum, a clout upon that head
Which was declining on the milky head
With all my imperfections on my head

Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head

And, at our more considered time, we'll read
He took my father grossly, full of bread
sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, an we had
But look, the morn in russet mantle clad
You are welcome, masters; welcome all.--I am glad
HAMLET  How came he mad
POLONIUS  That hath made him mad
QUEEN  Alas, he's mad
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad
What is 't but to be nothing else but mad
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad
If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
When second husband kisses me in bed
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
closet ere you go to bed
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
Good night. But go not to my uncle's bed
Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed
An thou hadst not come to my bed
Go to thy deathbed
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced
pronounced
HAMLET  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced
To be commanded
POLONIUS  This business is well ended
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended
Mother, you have my father much offended
It is offended
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded
But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed
As false as dicers' oaths--O, such a deed
But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
KING  O heavy deed
Where truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed
OSRIC  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed
HAMLET  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed
Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
Stick fiery off indeed
I know him well. He is the brooch indeed
POLONIUS  By th' Mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed
A combination and a form indeed
morning, 'twas then indeed
QUEEN  So he does indeed
That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
eat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed
KING  She swoons to see them bleed
I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed
She should in ground unsanctified been lodged
Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged
Let come what comes, only I'll be revenged
Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged
Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
Repugnant to command. Unequal matched
Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
And, where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weighed
And you must needs have heard, how I am punished
ape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed
Of his own just remove; the people muddied
To the unsatisfied
I did repel his letters and denied
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried
Indeed distract; her mood will needs be pitied
KING  'Tis Hamlet's character. "Naked
Now is he total gules, horridly tricked
OPHELIA  'Tis in my memory locked
Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked
So, lust, though to a radiant angel linked
HORATIO  How was this sealed
commeddled
Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled
In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled
To tell him his commandment is fulfilled
To draw apart the body he hath killed
Within his truncheon's length, whilst they, distilled
An understanding simple and unschooled
No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled
LAERTES  My lord, I will be ruled
But let this same be presently performed
HORATIO  You might have rhymed
And carriage of the article designed
That have a father killed, a mother stained
To hear him so inclined
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned
damned
And so am I revenged. That would be scanned
them through and through the most fanned
That from her working all his visage wanned
Never to rise again. Thy mother's poisoned
Yes, it is already garrisoned
And, with his head over his shoulder turned
Was gaged by our king, which had returned
To thine own peace. If he be now returned
Are joyfully returned
QUEEN  Drowned, drowned
GRAVEDIGGER  How can that be, unless she drowned
LAERTES  Alas, then she is drowned
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
HAMLET  Pale or red
Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared
His nephew's levies, which to him appeared
Wherein necessity, of matter beggared
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared
hundred
Be all my sins remembered
question of the play be then to be considered
That I, the son of a dear father murdered
distempered
flattered
A sable silvered
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered
Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred
Wherein we saw thee quietly interred
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
As had he been encorpsed and demi-natured
KING  Part them. They are incensed
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed
When that her golden couplets are disclosed
And with them words of so sweet breath composed
That cannot be, since I am still possessed
well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used
That on the supervise, no leisure bated
When he the ambitious Norway combated
Hamlet and Laertes are separated
Wherein our Savior's birth is celebrated
Have heaven and Earth together demonstrated
Enter Ophelia distracted
He does confess he feels himself distracted
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted
ROSENCRANTZ  Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted
Which now goes too free-footed
firmament, this majestical roof, fretted
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
fitted
Or like a creature native and endued
And gather by him, as he is behaved
By desperate appliance are relieved
O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved
It was against your Highness. Whereat, grieved
deceived
OPHELIA  I was the more deceived
My father, in his habit as he lived
But virtue, as it never will be moved
LAERTES  He is justly served
of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
So think thou wilt no second husband wed
You promised me to wed
Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed
Not shriving time allowed
unfellowed
when I was in the city? Are they so followed
HAMLET  Safely stowed
Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
Friends both, go join you with some further aid
Let in the maid, that out a maid
I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid
they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
And, as you said (and wisely was it said
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
HORATIO  My lord, I did
Come short of what he did
My honored lord, you know right well you did
HAMLET  Do they hold the same estimation they did
In dreadful secrecy impart they did
Which happily foreknowing may avoid
Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield
them, for they say an old man is twice a child
But if 't be he I mean, he's very wild
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old
To mine own room again, making so bold
For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold
To what I shall unfold
My fears forgetting manners) to unfold
Should have a back or second that might hold
All from her father's death, and now behold
offense i' th' world

And let me speak to th' yet unknowing world
Seem to me all the uses of this world
In the corrupted currents of this world
which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should

That treason can but peep to what it would
Mark you, your party in converse, him you would
but I cannot choose but weep to think they would
We should do when we would; for this "would
make yourselves another. You jig and amble, and
chiefly loved. 'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido, and
monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and
ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and
HAMLET  Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and
receive from you. We coted them on the way, and
trade that he will keep out water a great while; and
Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and

That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and
Have of your audience been most free and
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and
HAMLET  O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and
that often madness hits on, which reason and
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
POLONIUS  Look whe'er he has not turned his color and
whipping? Use them after your own honor and
murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces and
Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and
of playing, whose end, both at the first and
Flourish. Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and
Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and
beauty of the world, the paragon of animals--and
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
LAERTES  Know you the hand
The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
But to recover of us, by strong hand
If by direct or by collateral hand
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
HAMLET  No, by this hand
Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
So nightly toils the subject of the land
Of this posthaste and rummage in the land
And hath shipped me into the land
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England
Ambassadors to Denmark from England
England
It must be shortly known to him from England
I cannot live to hear the news from England
You from the Polack wars, and you from England
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England

HAMLET  Ay, marry, why was he sent into England
For England
HAMLET  For England
CAPTAIN  Against some part of Poland
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand
Th' important acting of your dread command
No, my good lord, but as you did command
An eye like Mars' to threaten and command
Put your dread pleasures more into command
A royal knavery--an exact command
be one man picked out of ten thousand
I dare damnation. To this point I stand
Conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand
HORATIO  Do, if it will not stand
my father died. They say he made a good end
That's the end
No more--and by a sleep to say we end
And each particular hair to stand an end
As make your bouts more violent to that end
For who not needs shall never lack a friend
For loan oft loses both itself and friend
And you must put me in your heart for friend
own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend
REYNALDO  At "closes in the consequence," at "friend
HAMLET  Yours. [Osric exits.] He does well to commend
Perpend
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend
The time invests you. Go, your servants tend
Love? His affections do not that way tend
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
KING  Attend
If circumstances lead me, I will find
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind
This bad begins, and worse remains behind
I must be cruel only to be kind
A little more than kin and less than kind
Honored, beloved; and haply one as kind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind
With all the strength and armor of the mind
Take these again, for to the noble mind
Tis too narrow for your mind
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind
with you: why do you go about to recover the wind
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
The single and peculiar life is bound
And, like a man to double business bound
As it hath used to do, that I have found
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
But, better looked into, he truly found
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground
It waves you to a more removed ground
We go to gain a little patch of ground
Millions of acres on us, till our ground
Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground
HORATIO  Friends to this ground
HAMLET  Upon what ground
sound
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God, God
HAMLET  O God
LAERTES  Do you see this, O God
POLONIUS  With what, i' th' name of God
now o'erreaches, one that would circumvent God
HAMLET  Good
I am very glad to see you. [To Barnardo.] Good
HAMLET  Or of a courtier, which could say "Good
Form of the thing (each word made true and good
That to the use of actions fair and good
No med'cine in the world can do thee good
POLONIUS  'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good
It is not, nor it cannot come to good
POLONIUS  That's good. "Mobled queen" is good
blood
A savageness in unreclaimed blood
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
Will want true color--tears perchance for blood
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood
Excitements of my reason and my blood
Repast them with my blood
little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood
And that your Grace hath screened and stood
So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
HAMLET  That's wormwood
HAMLET  It shall to the barber's with your beard
About, my brains!--Hum, I have heard
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Never to speak of this that you have heard
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
As did that one, and that, in my regard
He took me by the wrist and held me hard
Hoist with his own petard; and 't shall go hard
Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard

I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
That it be proof and bulwark against sense
Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blessed are those
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
What to ourselves in passion we propose
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
nature. For anything so o'erdone is from the purpose
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
When he lay couched in th' ominous horse
OPHELIA  Still better and worse
In obstinate condolement is a course
And with th' incorporal air do hold discourse
Sure He that made us with such large discourse
I had my father's signet in my purse
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
For this effect defective comes by cause
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause
That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
To tell the secrets of my prison house
Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse
There was he gaming, there o'ertook in 's rouse
The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
If thou art privy to thy country's fate
But woe is me! You are so sick of late
What, have you given him any hard words of late
Tis told me he hath very oft of late
And our affairs from England come too late
It is the poisoned cup. It is too late
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
GENTLEMAN  She is importunate
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Let me be no assistant for a state
with cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state
The safety and the health of this whole state
Of his true state
So far from cheer and from your former state
Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state
This bodes some strange eruption to our state
As it doth well appear unto our state
Fordo its own life. 'Twas of some estate
Yorick! I knew him, Horatio--a fellow of infinite
The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
As of a father; for let the world take note
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note
Or such ambiguous giving-out, to note
Th' effect of what I wrote
That else leans on th' affair. Pray you, make haste
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste
Eats not the flats with more impiteous haste
What might be toward that this sweaty haste
For the demand of our neglected tribute
The pith and marrow of our attribute
The perfume and suppliance of a minute
HAMLET  If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue
Give it an understanding but no tongue
What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue
Enter Prologue
GRAVEDIGGER  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue
This above all: to thine own self be true
KING, [aside]  O, 'tis too true
As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true
HAMLET  In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true
POLONIUS  'Tis most true
Collected from all simples that have virtue
HAMLET  You should not have believed me, for virtue
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue
something. Where did I leave
Occasion smiles upon a second leave
I'll board him presently. O, give me leave
LAERTES  I pray you, give me leave
Hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave
My lord, I have
hold their course for England; of them I have
QUEEN  What would she have
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
more on 't. It hath made me mad. I say we will have
Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
HORATIO [reads the letter]  Horatio, when thou shalt have
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have
to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have
GENTLEMAN  Seafaring men, sir. They say they have
Who was in life a foolish prating knave
But he's an arrant knave
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave
LAERTES, [coming out of the grave
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
Leaps in the grave
OTHER  I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave
To outface me with leaping in her grave
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave
And not have strewed thy grave
HAMLET  Into my grave
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
Before my God, I might not this believe
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes--believe
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive
a thousand pound. Didst perceive
They find us touched, we will our kingdom give
And thy commandment all alone shall live
HAMLET  Nay, but to live
epitaph than their ill report while you live
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
I could not but by her. The other motive
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve
HORATIO  I think it lacks of twelve
Buys out the law. But 'tis not so above
Anon, as patient as the female dove
Fare you well, my dove
To contract--O--the time for--a--my behove
But never doubt I love
In youth when I did love, did love
I do receive your offered love like love
Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
There lives within the very flame of love
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love
As meditation or the thoughts of love
This is the very ecstasy of love
And with no less nobility of love
Could not with all their quantity of love
Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
If thou didst ever thy dear father love
More grief to hide than hate to utter love
This mad young man. But so much was our love
HAMLET  I could interpret between you and your love
HAMLET  As woman's love
KING  But how hath she received his love
awhile but in the end accepts his love
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
For women fear too much, even as they love
Mad for thy love
The instances that second marriage move
Doubt that the sun doth move
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
move
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve
There's rue for you, and here's some for me; we
As "Well, well, we know," or "We could an if we
GUILDENSTERN  Faith, her privates we
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
With an auspicious and a dropping eye
He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
As day does to your eye
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye
We shall express our duty in his eye
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye
I have a speech o' fire that fain would blaze
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize
HAMLET, [aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If
mischief
What is he whose grief
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief
Laertes, I must commune with your grief
The origin and commencement of his grief
Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief
By his cockle hat and staff
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
My head should be struck off
Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off
A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off
ordnance are shot off
you love me, hold not off
If it be made of penetrable stuff
once. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
And live the purer with the other half
Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself
So much from th' understanding of himself
The devil himself
were to know himself
It is a poison tempered by himself
When down her weedy trophies and herself
I loved your father, and we love ourself
Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself
Observe his inclination in yourself
Given private time to you, and you yourself
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
It sends some precious instance of itself
Thought and afflictions, passion, hell itself
Being a thing immortal as itself
Whose violent property fordoes itself
With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself
HORATIO  As thou art to thyself
thyself
purpose, confess thyself
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself
else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself
Must render up myself
How strange or odd some'er I bear myself
Lives almost by his looks, and for myself
Horatio--or I do forget myself
That to Laertes I forgot myself
Behind the arras I'll convey myself
HAMLET  It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of
How now, my lord, will the King hear this piece of
HAMLET  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
ROSENCRANTZ  Good my lord, what is your cause of
Lord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of
HAMLET  It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of
plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of
head upon her neck. He lies him down upon a bank of
They exit, marching, after the which, a peal of
HAMLET, [to Osric]  What imports the nomination of

thereabout of it especially when he speaks of
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of
having th' accent of Christians nor the gait of
the tune of the time, and, out of an habit of
Than fly to others that we know not of
HAMLET  'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of
embracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show of
lay him i' th' cold ground. My brother shall know of
HORATIO  Custom hath made it in him a property of
observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
And that I see, in passages of proof
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
At his head a grass-green turf
Until my eyelids will no longer wag
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg
MARCELLUS  Is it not like the King
There is a play tonight before the King
BARNARDO  Long live the King
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King
Come, go with me. I will go seek the King
An earnest conjuration from the King
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King
body is and go with us to the King
But soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King
work.	[Hurts the King
HAMLET  Nay, I know not. Is it the King
Enter King
HAMLET, [advancing
reading
I think it was to see my mother's wedding
What company, at what expense; and finding
agreeing
Confederate season, else no creature seeing
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging
with the body. The King is a thing
HAMLET  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing
More relative than this. The play's the thing
at that.--Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing
Or is it some abuse and no such thing
And then it started like a guilty thing
HAMLET  Nothing
Did nothing
BARNARDO  I have seen nothing
With forms to his conceit--and all for nothing
That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing
As one in suffering all that suffers nothing
There's such divinity doth hedge a king
replication should be made by the son of a king
As kill a king
And can say nothing--no, not for a king
They cry "Choose we, Laertes shall be king
Comes armed through our watch so like the king
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king
vile king
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king
Laertes shall be king! Laertes king
Both to my God and to my gracious king
At least the whisper goes so: our last king
I saw him once. He was a goodly king
Even in their promise as it is a-making
sings in grave-making
This man shall set me packing
As 'twere a thing a little soiled i' th' working
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking
them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
When thou liest howling
In censure of his seeming
I hear him coming
HAMLET  Upon the talk of the poisoning
Awake the god of day, and at his warning
His silence will sit drooping
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping
HAMLET  Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
POLONIUS  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing
The canker galls the infants of the spring
FRANCISCO  Not a mouse stirring
HAMLET  That skull had a tongue in it and could sing
KING, [rising
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting
And sure I am two men there is not living
Most generous, and free from all contriving
reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
differences, of very soft society and great showing
GUILDENSTERN  O, there has been much throwing
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
Now might I do it pat, now he is a-praying
if I could see the puppets dallying
Lords attendant with the King's guard carrying
POLONIUS  This is too long
This bird of dawning singeth all night long
HAMLET  Very like. Stayed it long
Therefore I have entreated him along
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song
my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
Believe so much in him that he is young
our withers are unwrung
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg
In going back to school in Wittenberg
I pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg
HAMLET  Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah
Whose grave's this, sirrah
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech
Do not itself unkennel in one speech
quality. Come, a passionate speech
night's speech
My virtue or my plague, be it either which
I'll tent him to the quick. If he do blench
I have seen myself, and served against, the French
lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Appears before them and with solemn march
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
LAERTES  To cut his throat i' th' church
Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
I your commission will forthwith dispatch
And I with them the third night kept the watch
My lord, upon the platform where we watch
Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Hath clawed me in his clutch
A baseness to write fair, and labored much
for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much
You have been talked of since your travel much
well digested in the scenes, set down with as much
method, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
Without the sensible and true avouch
ROSENCRANTZ  Even those you were wont to take such
As if I had never been such
received it, and others whose judgments in such
of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh
And then this "should" is like a spendthrift sigh
part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh
tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh
thick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh
crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis a chough
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
A stallion! Fie upon 't! Foh
For though I am not splenitive and rash
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
Sound a flourish
As love between them like the palm might flourish
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh
poisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems harsh
Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush
We'll put the matter to the present push
POLONIUS  I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i' th
Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death
It may be death
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
He should those bearers put to sudden death
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death
But that the dread of something after death
He never gave commandment for their death
That I am guiltless of your father's death
With pestilent speeches of his father's death
Which I have told thee of my father's death
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
O wretched state! O bosom black as death
Gives me superfluous death
To muddy death
Is by a forged process of my death
And hears it roar beneath
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath
QUEEN  He's fat and scant of breath
The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath
gentleman in our more rawer breath
ROSENCRANTZ  Then thus she says: your behavior hath
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
This likes me well. These foils have all a length
OSRIC  Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith
MARCELLUS  Nor I, my lord, in faith
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with
for your dull ass will not mend his pace with

And you are stayed for. There, my blessing with

Here's to thy health
Than I to Hercules. Within a month
By what it fed on. And yet, within a month
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both

I do not fear it; I have seen you both
I cannot dream of. I entreat you both

LAERTES  Lay her i' th' earth

As the indifferent children of the earth
returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth
This must be so." We pray you, throw to earth
For he himself is subject to his birth
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
Holding a weak supposal of our worth
The hand more instrumental to the mouth

Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou 'lt mouth
it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth
Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth
A very ribbon in the cap of youth
And, in the morn and liquid dew of youth
That unmatched form and stature of blown youth
What is between you? Give me up the truth
Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth
And of all Christians' souls, I pray God. God be wi
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
O, speak
Stay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak

For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak
Of that I shall have also cause to speak
speak
But from what cause he will by no means speak
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak
KING  Why, now you speak
I do believe you think what now you speak
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak
speak
But what we do determine oft we break
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back
QUEEN  Alack
And that his soul may be as damned and black
Nor customary suits of solemn black
HAMLET  So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack
So levied as before, against the Polack
Of reverend Priam, seemed i' th' air to stick
It faded on the crowing of the cock
A very very--pajock
would seem to know my stops, you would pluck
MARCELLUS  No, it is struck
So bloodily hast struck
If he by chance escape your venomed stuck
Does not divide the Sunday from the week
And with a larger tether may he walk
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
And curd, like eager droppings into milk
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
I bought an unction of a mountebank
As level as the cannon to his blank
What forgeries you please--marry, none so rank
Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think
I do not know, my lord, what I should think
How say you, then? Would heart of man once think
Your wisdom best shall think
Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
I would fain prove so. But what might you think
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink
KING  Gertrude, do not drink
Enter Hamlet reading on a book
If I had played the desk or table-book
book
Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look
There is a willow grows askant the brook
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
HAMLET  That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark
My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark
OPHELIA  Pray you, mark
OPHELIA  Say you? Nay, pray you, mark
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Denmark
Denmark
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark
There's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
What might you think? No, I went round to work
work
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical
We do it wrong, being so majestical
To his own scandal
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal
Which was the model of that Danish seal
Where every god did seem to set his seal
As e'er my conversation coped withal
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
word, the word to the action, with this special
And for your rapier most especial
in trial
Of bell and burial
Christian burial
Christian burial
GRAVEDIGGER  Is she to be buried in Christian burial
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial
AMBASSADOR  The sight is dismal
His means of death, his obscure funeral
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral
Sblood, there is something in this more than natural
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural
Let me be cruel, not unnatural
Look where he goes even now out at the portal
Gives him three-score thousand crowns in annual
One woe doth tread upon another's heel
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
What's near it with it; or it is a massy wheel
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Bow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
shape of a camel
And bear it to the chapel
With variable objects, shall expel
was converted might they not stop a beer barrel
POLONIUS  It is backed like a weasel
HAMLET  Methinks it is like a weasel
May fit us to our shape. If this should fail
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
of me, as if you would drive me into a toil
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
From that particular fault. The dram of evil
In further evil
To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil
like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We'll
wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all
BARNARDO  Last night of all
cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all
He was a man. Take him for all in all
His liberty is full of threats to all
The better to beguile. This is for all
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And so, without more circumstance at all
Unless things mortal move them not at all
Or not at all
Madam, I swear I use no art at all
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all
But our cold maids do "dead men's fingers" call
To be forestalled ere we come to fall
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
Under the which he shall not choose but fall
And where th' offense is, let the great ax fall
But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
GRAVEDIGGER  Why, because he was mad. He shall
shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall
cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall

man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall

What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell

As if he had been loosed out of hell
Rebellious hell
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
OTHER  Marry, now I can tell
about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell
OTHER  Mass, I cannot tell
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
HAMLET  I have heard of your paintings too, well
HAMLET  That's two of his weapons. But, well
HAMLET  I humbly thank you, well
The which he loved passing well
daughter that I love passing well
with him in excellence. But to know a man well
Whose blood and judgment are so well
And for my means, I'll husband them so well
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
I will bestow him and will answer well
KING  It likes us well
Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
My father's spirit--in arms! All is not well
And, in part, him, but," you may say, "not well
HAMLET  I am glad to see you well
POLONIUS  God be wi' you. Fare you well
I will requite your loves. So fare you well

My necessaries are embarked. Farewell

Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will

Affection, puh! You speak like a green girl
Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful
HAMLET  O, wonderful
As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful
And my imaginations are as foul
The inward service of the mind and soul
She is so conjunctive to my life and soul
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
O, step between her and her fighting soul
And we shall jointly labor with your soul
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
To take him in the purging of his soul
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul

Thou turn'st my eyes into my very soul

I shall in all my best obey you, madam
HAMLET  Good madam
the shadow of a dream
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
Now falls on Priam
HAMLET  What, are they children? Who maintains 'em
This sudden sending him away must seem
That can denote me truly. These indeed "seem
a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them
them
them
them
But not where I have aimed them
They were given me by Claudio. He received them
You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them
journeymen had made men, and not made them
I pray you now receive them
Do you believe his "tenders," as you call them
Will you two help to hasten them
That for some vicious mole of nature in them
KING  From Hamlet? Who brought them
Of him that brought them
To him from whom you brought them
at my beck than I have thoughts to put them
him
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him
This night to play before him
OPHELIA  Heavenly powers, restore him
HORATIO  Heavens secure him
And from his mother's closet hath he dragged him
For so this side of our known world esteemed him
HORATIO  I did very well note him
And will not let belief take hold of him
HORATIO  A piece of him
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him
HAMLET  Ay, sir, what of him
OSRIC  Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him
Pray you, be round with him
To show his grief. Let her be round with him
That, being of so young days brought up with him
does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him
No more to undertake it, I will work him
We cannot get from him
Did not together pluck such envy from him
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
And thus awhile the fit will work on him
You must not put another scandal on him
Addicted so and so." And there put on him
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him
he goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him

At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him

Two nights together had these gentlemen
Upon the witness of these gentlemen

Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven

Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon
Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son
Where is your son
To show yourself indeed your father's son
Than that which dearest father bears his son
But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son

O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason

Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason

I think it be no other but e'en so
OSRIC  Shall I deliver you e'en so
Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so

That I have positively said "'Tis so

That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so
I do repent; but heaven hath pleased it so
If damned custom have not brazed it so
The rather if you could devise it so
HAMLET  No, by the rood, not so
OPHELIA  No more but so
And let him know so
POLONIUS  I will say so
your smiling you seem to say so
I would not hear your enemy say so

Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep

The bark is ready, and the wind at help
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Unpeg the basket on the house's top
You mainly were stirred up
Or pardoned being down? Then I'll look up
within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up
O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up
Give him the cup
He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup
Here's yet some liquor left.	[He picks up the cup
She lifts the cup
Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
All given to mine ear

And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear
For thou dost know, O Damon dear
HAMLET  Why, what should be the fear
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear
Almost to jelly with the act of fear
Be wary, then; best safety lies in fear
For we will fetters put about this fear
The virtue of his will; but you must fear
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear
HAMLET  For God's love, let me hear
HAMLET  Nor did you nothing hear
KING  Laertes, you shall hear
HAMLET  Speak. I am bound to hear
O, speak of that! That do I long to hear
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear
How these things came about. So shall you hear
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near
youth, I suffered much extremity for love, very near

Doubt truth to be a liar
both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar
Being nature's livery or fortune's star
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star

And foreign mart for implements of war
And pious action we do sugar o'er
Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber
That hurts by easing. But to the quick of th' ulcer

Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder

And, but that great command o'ersways the order
And, as I think, they have already order
HAMLET  Murder
Of those effects for which I did the murder
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
Can serve my turn? "Forgive me my foul murder

To sing a requiem and such rest to her
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her
There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her

Have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher
But you must know your father lost a father

Been thus encountered: a figure like your father
Not that I think you did not love your father
My lord, the King your father

Requite him for your father

God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together
Nay, come, let's go together

Go to your rest. At night we'll feast together

Why does the drum come hither
Fortune that she sends you to prison hither
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither

find him not there, seek him i' th' other
Folded the writ up in the form of th' other

Good night, mother

Tis meet that some more audience than a mother
A bloody deed--almost as bad, good mother
Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother
Of my true mother
Farewell, dear mother
HAMLET  We shall obey, were she ten times our mother
But yet to me they're strong. The Queen his mother
Therefore no more but to the matter. My mother
Man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother
shall command--or, rather, as you say, my mother
He that hath killed my king and whored my mother
And (would it were not so) you are my mother
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
Would quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother

This is too heavy. Let me see another

I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.	[She drinks

About her lank and all o'erteemed loins

They have proclaimed their malefactions
Ghost beckons
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
KING  O, for two special reasons
The fair Ophelia.--Nymph, in thy orisons
The insolence of office, and the spurns
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
The tedious day with sleep.	[Sleeps
But age with his stealing steps
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
For out o' doors he went without their helps

These words like daggers enter in my ears

And his commission to employ those soldiers

Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters
But keep a farm and carters

Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats

Thrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets

Yet have I in me something dangerous
Majesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous

Thou still hast been the father of good news
She is a strumpet. What news
How now? What news

There's letters sealed; and my two schoolfellows
This was your husband. Look you now what follows

Speak of it.	[The cock crows
